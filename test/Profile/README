These are tests for instrumentation based profiling. This specifically
means the -fprofile-instr-generate and -fprofile-instr-use driver flags.

Tests in this directory should test both the generation of profile
data, and the use of that same data. As such, the input source file
should include a main function such that building with -use and
running the resulting program would generate the input data that is
consumed in the -generate case.
