// C Language Family Front-end
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//

I. Introduction:
 
 clang: noun
    1. A loud, resonant, metallic sound.
    2. The strident call of a crane or goose.
    3. C-language front-end toolkit.
    
 Why?
 Supports Objective-C.


II. Current advantages over GCC:

 * Full column number support in diagnostics.
 * Caret diagnostics.
 * Full diagnostic customization by client (can format diagnostics however they
   like, e.g. in an IDE or refactoring tool).
 * Built as a framework, can be reused by multiple tools.
 * All languages supported linked into same library (no cc1,cc1obj, ...).
 * mmap's code in read-only, does not dirty the pages like GCC (mem footprint).
 * BSD License, can be linked into non-GPL projects.
 
Future Features:
 * Full diagnostic control, per diagnostic (use enums).
 * Fine grained control within the source (#pragma enable/disable warning)
 * Faster than GCC, preprocessing, parsing, IR generation.
 * Better token tracking within macros?  (Token came from this line, which is
   a macro argument instantiated here, recursively instantiated here).
 * Fast #import!!


III. Critical Missing Functionality

Lexer:
 * Source character mapping.  GCC supports ASCII and UTF-8.
   See GCC options: -ftarget-charset and -ftarget-wide-charset.
 * Universal character support.  Experimental in GCC, enabled with
   -fextended-identifiers.
 * -fpreprocessed mode.

Preprocessor:
 * Function-style #define & macro expansion
 * #line / #file directives
 * Detection of "atomic" headers: #if !defined.
 * -C output mode in -E mode.

Traditional Preprocessor:
 * All.
    
Parser Callbacks:
 * All.
 
Parser Actions:
 * All.
 * Need some way to effeciently either work in 'callback'/devkit mode or in
   default AST building mode.

Fast #Import:
 * All.
 * Get frameworks that don't use #import to do so, e.g. 
   DirectoryService, AudioToolbox, CoreFoundation, etc.  Why not using #import,
   because they work in C mode?
 * Have the lexer return a token for #import instead of handling it itself.
   - Create a new preprocessor object with no external state (no -D/U options
     from the command line, etc).  Alternatively, keep track of exactly which
     external state is used by a #import: declare it somehow.
 * When having reading a #import file, keep track of whether we have (and/or
   which) seen any "configuration" macros.  Various cases:
   - Uses of target args (__POWERPC__, __i386): Header has to be parsed 
     multiple times, per-target.  What about #ifndef checks?  How do we know?
   - "Configuration" preprocessor macros not defined: POWERPC, etc.  What about
     things like __STDC__ etc?  What is and what isn't allowed.
 * Special handling for "umbrella" headers, which just contain #import stmts:
   - Cocoa.h/AppKit.h - Contain pointers to digests instead of entire digests
     themselves?  Foundation.h isn't pure umbrella!
 * Frameworks digests:
   - Can put "digest" of a framework-worth of headers into the framework
     itself.  To open AppKit, just mmap
     /System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/"digest", which provides a
     symbol table in a well defined format.  Lazily unstream stuff that is
     needed.  Contains declarations, macros, and debug information.
   - System frameworks ship with digests.  How do we handle configuration
     information?  How do we handle stuff like:
       #if MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED >= MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_2
     which guards a bunch of decls?  Should there be a couple of default
     configs, then have the UI fall back to building/caching its own?
   - GUI automatically builds digests when UI is idle, both of system
     frameworks if they aren't not available in the right config, and of app
     frameworks.
   - GUI builds dependence graph of frameworks/digests based on #imports.  If a
     digest is out date, dependent digests are automatically invalidated.

 * New constraints on #import for objc-v3:
   - #imported file must not define non-inline function bodies.
     - Alternatively, they can, and these bodies get compiled/linked *once*
       per app into a dylib.  What about building user dylibs?
   - Restrictions on ObjC grammar: can't #import the body of a for stmt or fn.
   - Compiler must detect and reject these cases.
   - #defines defined within a #import have two behaviors:
     - By default, they escape the header.  These macros *cannot* be #undef'd
       by other code: this is enforced by the front-end.
     - Optionally, user can specify what macros escape (whitelist) or can use
       #undef.

New language feature: Configuration queries:
  - Instead of #ifdef __POWERPC__, use "if (strcmp(`cpu`, __POWERPC__))", or
    some other syntax.
  - Use it to increase the number of "architecture-clean" #import'd files.

Cocoa GUI Front-end:
 * All.
 * Start with very simple "textedit" GUI.
 * Trivial project model: list of files, list of cmd line options.
 * Build simple developer examples.
 * Tight integration with compiler components.
 * Primary advantage: batch compiles, keeping digests in memory, dependency mgmt
   between app frameworks, building code/digests in the background, etc.
