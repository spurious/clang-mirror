<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<p>The Clang Compiler is an open-source compiler for the C family of programming
languages, aiming to be the best in class implementation of these languages.
Clang builds on the LLVM optimizer and code generator, allowing it to provide
high-quality optimization and code generation support for many targets.  For
more general information, please see the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang
Web Site</a> or the <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM Web Site</a>.</p>

<p>This document describes important notes about using Clang as a compiler for
an end-user, documenting the supported features, command line options, etc.  If
you are interested in using Clang to build a tool that processes code, please
see <a href="InternalsManual.html">the Clang Internals Manual</a>.  If you are
interested in the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/StaticAnalysis.html">Clang
Static Analyzer</a>, please see its web page.</p>

<p>Clang is designed to support the C family of programming languages, which
includes <a href="#c">C</a>, <a href="#objc">Objective-C</a>, <a
href="#cxx">C++</a>, and <a href="#objcxx">Objective-C++</a> as well as many
dialects of those.  For language-specific information, please see the
corresponding language specific section:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#c">C Language</a>: K&amp;R C, ANSI C89, ISO C90, ISO C94
    (C89+AMD1), ISO C99 (+TC1, TC2, TC3). </li>
<li><a href="#objc">Objective-C Language</a>: ObjC 1, ObjC 2, ObjC 2.1, plus
    variants depending on base language.</li>
<li><a href="#cxx">C++ Language Features</a></li>
<li><a href="#objcxx">Objective C++ Language</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these base languages and their dialects, Clang supports a
broad variety of language extensions, which are documented in the corresponding
language section.  These extensions are provided to be compatible with the GCC,
Microsoft, and other popular compilers as well as to improve functionality
through Clang-specific features.  The Clang driver and language features are
intentionally designed to be as compatible with the GNU GCC compiler as
reasonably possible, easing migration from GCC to Clang.  In most cases, code
"just works".</p>

<p>In addition to language specific features, Clang has a variety of features
that depend on what CPU architecture or operating system is being compiled for.
Please see the <a href="target_features">Target-Specific Features and
Limitations</a> section for more details.</p>

<p>The rest of the introduction introduces some basic <a
href="#terminology">compiler terminology</a> that is used throughout this manual
and contains a basic <a href="#basicusage">introduction to using Clang</a>
as a command line compiler.</p>

This section is generally an index into other sections.  It does not go into
depth on the ones that are covered by other sections.  However, the first part
introduces the language selection and other high level options like -c, -g, etc.

<h4 id="cl_diag_formatting">Formatting of Diagnostics</h4>
<!-- ================================================= -->

<p>Clang aims to produce beautiful diagnostics by default, particularly for new
users that first come to Clang.  However, different people have different
preferences, and sometimes Clang is driven by another program, not a person. For
these cases, Clang provides a wide range of options to control the exact output
format of the diagnostics that it generates.</p>

<dl>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<dt id="opt_fshow-column"><b>-f[no-]show-column</b>: Print column number in
diagnostic.</dt>
<dd>This option, which defaults to on, controls whether or not Clang prints the
column number of a diagnostic.  For example, when this is enabled, Clang will
print something like:</p>

<pre>
  test.c:28:8: warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive [-Wextra-tokens]
  #endif bad
         ^
         //
</pre>

<p>When this is disabled, Clang will print "test.c:28: warning..." with no
column number.</p>
</dd>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<dt id="opt_fshow-source-location"><b>-f[no-]show-source-location</b>: Print
source file/line/column information in diagnostic.</dt>
<dd>This option, which defaults to on, controls whether or not Clang prints the
filename, line number and column number of a diagnostic.  For example,
when this is enabled, Clang will print something like:</p>

<pre>
  test.c:28:8: warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive [-Wextra-tokens]
  #endif bad
         ^
         //
</pre>

<p>When this is disabled, Clang will not print the "test.c:28:8: " part.</p>
</dd>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<dt id="opt_fcaret-diagnostics"><b>-f[no-]caret-diagnostics</b>: Print source
line and ranges from source code in diagnostic.</dt>
<dd>This option, which defaults to on, controls whether or not Clang prints the
source line, source ranges, and caret when emitting a diagnostic.  For example,
when this is enabled, Clang will print something like:</p>

<pre>
  test.c:28:8: warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive [-Wextra-tokens]
  #endif bad
         ^
         //
</pre>

<p>When this is disabled, Clang will just print:</p>

<pre>
  test.c:28:8: warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive [-Wextra-tokens]
</pre>

</dd>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<dt id="opt_fdiagnostics-show-option"><b>-f[no-]diagnostics-show-option</b>:
Enable <tt>[-Woption]</tt> information in diagnostic line.</dt>
<dd>This option, which defaults to on,
controls whether or not Clang prints the associated <A
href="#cl_diag_warning_groups">warning group</a> option name when outputting
a warning diagnostic.  For example, in this output:</p>

<pre>
  test.c:28:8: warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive [-Wextra-tokens]
  #endif bad
         ^
         //
</pre>

<p>Passing <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</b> will prevent Clang from printing
the [<a href="#opt_Wextra-tokens">-Wextra-tokens</a>] information in the
diagnostic.  This information tells you the flag needed to enable or disable the
diagnostic, either from the command line or through <a 
href="#pragma_GCC_diagnostic">#pragma GCC diagnostic</a>.</dd>


<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<dt id="opt_fdiagnostics-fixit-info"><b>-f[no-]diagnostics-fixit-info</b>:
Enable "FixIt" information in the diagnostics output.</dt>
<dd>This option, which defaults to on, controls whether or not Clang prints the
information on how to fix a specific diagnostic underneath it when it knows.
For example, in this output:</p>

<pre>
  test.c:28:8: warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive [-Wextra-tokens]
  #endif bad
         ^
         //
</pre>

<p>Passing <b>-fno-diagnostics-fixit-info</b> will prevent Clang from printing
the "//" line at the end of the message.  This information is useful for users
who may not understand what is wrong, but can be confusing for machine
parsing.</p>
</dd>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<dt id="opt_fprint-source-range-info"><b>-f[no-]print-source-range-info</b>:
Print machine parsable information about source ranges.</dt>
<dd>This option, which defaults to off, controls whether or not Clang prints
information about source ranges in a machine parsable format after the
file/line/column number information.  The information is a simple sequence of
brace enclosed ranges, where each range lists the start and end line/column
locations.  For example, in this output:</p>

<pre>
exprs.c:47:15:{47:8-47:14}{47:17-47:24}: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('int *' and '_Complex float')
   P = (P-42) + Gamma*4;
       ~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~
</pre>

<p>The {}'s are generated by -fprint-source-range-info.</p>
</dd>


</dl>

 


<!-- ===================================================== -->
<h4 id="cl_diag_warning_groups">Individual Warning Groups</h4>
<!-- ===================================================== -->

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<dt id="opt_Wextra-tokens"><b>-Wextra-tokens</b>: Warn about excess tokens at
    the end of a preprocessor directive.</dt>
<dd>This option, which defaults to on, enables warnings about extra tokens at
the end of preprocessor directives.  For example:</p>

<pre>
  test.c:28:8: warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive [-Wextra-tokens]
  #endif bad
         ^
</pre>

<p>These extra tokens are not strictly conforming, and are usually best handled
by commenting them out.</p>

<p>This option is also enabled by <a href="">-Wfoo</a>, <a href="">-Wbar</a>,
 and <a href="">-Wbaz</a>.</p>

<h3 id="diagnostics">Controlling Errors and Warnings</h3>
<!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

<p>Clang provides a number of ways to control which code constructs cause it to

<h3 id="precompiledheaders">Precompiled Headers</h3>
<!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precompiled_header">Precompiled
headers</a> are a general approach employed by many compilers to reduce
compilation time. The underlying motivation of the approach is that it is
common for the same (and often large) header files to be included by
multiple source files. Consequently, compile times can often be greatly improved
by caching some of the (redundant) work done by a compiler to process headers.
Precompiled header files, which represent one of many ways to implement
this optimization, are literally files that represent an on-disk cache that
contains the vital information necessary to reduce some of the work
needed to process a corresponding header file. While details of precompiled
headers vary between compilers, precompiled headers have been shown to be a
highly effective at speeding up program compilation on systems with very large
system headers (e.g., Mac OS/X).</p>

<p>Clang supports an implementation of precompiled headers known as
<em>pre-tokenized headers</em> (PTH). Clang's pre-tokenized headers support most
of same interfaces as GCC's pre-compiled headers (as well as others) but are
completely different in their implementation.  If you are interested in how
PTH is implemented, please see the <a href="PTHInternals.html">PTH Internals
 document</a>.</p>

<h4>Generating a PTH File</h4>

<p>To generate a PTH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with
the <b><tt>-x <i>&lt;language&gt;</i>-header</tt></b> option. This mirrors the
interface in GCC for generating PCH files:</p>

<pre>
  $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch
  $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pth
</pre>

<h4>Using a PTH File</h4>

<p>A PTH file can then be used as a prefix header when a
<b><tt>-include</tt></b> option is passed to <tt>clang</tt>:</p>

<pre>
  $ clang -include test.h test.c -o test
</pre>

<p>The <tt>clang</tt> driver will first check if a PTH file for <tt>test.h</tt>
is available; if so, the contents of <tt>test.h</tt> (and the files it includes)
will be processed from the PTH file. Otherwise, Clang falls back to
directly processing the content of <tt>test.h</tt>. This mirrors the behavior of
GCC.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Clang does <em>not</em> automatically used PTH files
for headers that are directly included within a source file. For example:</p>

<pre>
  $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pth
  $ cat test.c
  #include "test.h"
  $ clang test.c -o test
</pre>

<p>In this example, <tt>clang</tt> will not automatically use the PTH file for
<tt>test.h</tt> since <tt>test.h</tt> was included directly in the source file
and not specified on the command line using <tt>-include</tt>.</p>
