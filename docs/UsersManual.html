<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<p>The Clang Compiler is an open-source compiler for the C family of programming
languages, aiming to be the best in class implementation of these languages.
Clang builds on the LLVM optimizer and code generator, allowing it to provide
high-quality optimization and code generation support for many targets.  For
more general information, please see the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang
Web Site</a> or the <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM Web Site</a>.</p>

<p>This document describes important notes about using Clang as a compiler for
an end-user, documenting the supported features, command line options, etc.  If
you are interested in using Clang to build a tool that processes code, please
see <a href="InternalsManual.html">the Clang Internals Manual</a>.  If you are
interested in the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/StaticAnalysis.html">Clang
Static Analyzer</a>, please see its web page.</p>

<p>Clang is designed to support the C family of programming languages, which
includes <a href="#c">C</a>, <a href="#objc">Objective-C</a>, <a
href="#cxx">C++</a>, and <a href="#objcxx">Objective-C++</a> as well as many
dialects of those.  For language-specific information, please see the
corresponding language specific section:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#c">C Language</a>: K&amp;R C, ANSI C89, ISO C90, ISO C94
    (C89+AMD1), ISO C99 (+TC1, TC2, TC3). </li>
<li><a href="#objc">Objective-C Language</a>: ObjC 1, ObjC 2, ObjC 2.1, plus
    variants depending on base language.</li>
<li><a href="#cxx">C++ Language Features</a></li>
<li><a href="#objcxx">Objective C++ Language</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these base languages and their dialects, Clang supports a
broad variety of language extensions, which are documented in the corresponding
language section.  These extensions are provided to be compatible with the GCC,
Microsoft, and other popular compilers as well as to improve functionality
through Clang-specific features.  The Clang driver and language features are
intentionally designed to be as compatible with the GNU GCC compiler as
reasonably possible, easing migration from GCC to Clang.  In most cases, code
"just works".</p>

<p>In addition to language specific features, Clang has a variety of features
that depend on what CPU architecture or operating system is being compiled for.
Please see the <a href="target_features">Target-Specific Features and
Limitations</a> section for more details.</p>

<p>The rest of the introduction introduces some basic <a
href="#terminology">compiler terminology</a> that is used throughout this manual
and contains a basic <a href="#basicusage">introduction to using Clang</a>
as a command line compiler.</p>

<p>
This section is generally an index into other sections.  It does not go into
depth on most.  However, the first part introduces the language selection and
other high level options like -c, -g, etc.

<h2 id="cxx">C++ Language Features</h2>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<p>At this point, Clang C++ is not generally useful.  However, Clang C++ support
is under active development and is progressing rapidly.  Please see the <a
href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html">C++ Status</a> page for details or
ask on the mailing list about how you can help.</p>

<p>Note that the clang driver will refuse to even try to use clang to compile
C++ code unless you pass the <tt>-ccc-clang-cxx</tt> option to the driver.  If
you really want to play with Clang's C++ support, please pass that flag. </p>
 
<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<h2 id="objcxx">Objective C++ Language Features</h2>
<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<p>At this point, Clang C++ support is not generally useful (and therefore,
neither is Objective-C++).  Please see the <a href="#cxx">C++ section</a> for
more information.</p>
