<h1>Precompiled Headers</h1>

  <p>This document describes the design and implementation of Clang's
  precompiled headers (PCH). If you are interested in the end-user
  view, please see the <a
   href="UsersManual.html#precompiledheaders">User's Manual</a>.</p>

<h2>Using precompiled headers with <tt>clang-cc</tt></h2>

<p>The low-level Clang compiler, <tt>clang-cc</tt>, supports two command
line options for generating and using PCH files.<p>

<p>To generate PCH files using <tt>clang-cc</tt>, use the option
<b><tt>-emit-pch</tt></b>:

<pre> $ clang-cc test.h -emit-pch -o test.h.pch </pre>

<p>This option is transparently used by <tt>clang</tt> when generating
PCH files. The resulting PCH file contains the serialized form of the
compiler's internal representation after it has completed parsing and
semantic analysis. The PCH file can then be used as a prefix header
with the <b><tt>-include-pch</tt></b> option:</p>

<pre>
  $ clang-cc -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test.s
</pre>

<h2>PCH Design Philosophy</h2>
  
<p>Precompiled headers are meant to improve overall compile times for
  projects, so the design of precompiled headers is entirely driven by
  performance concerns. The use case for precompiled headers is
  relatively simple: when there is a common set of headers that is
  included in nearly every source file in the project, we
  <i>precompile</i> that bundle of headers into a single precompiled
  header (PCH file). Then, when compiling the source files in the
  project, we load the PCH file first (as a prefix header), which acts
  as a stand-in for that bundle of headers.</p>

<p>A precompiled header implementation improves performance when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loading the PCH file is significantly faster than re-parsing the
  bundle of headers stored within the PCH file. Thus, a precompiled
  header design attempts to minimize the cost of reading the PCH
  file. Ideally, this cost should not vary with the size of the
  precompiled header file.</li>
  
  <li>The cost of generating the PCH file initially is not so large
  that it counters the per-source-file performance improvement due to
  eliminating the need to parse the bundled headers in the first
  place. This is particularly important on multi-core systems, because
  PCH file generation serializes the build when all compilations
  require the PCH file to be up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>More to be written...</p>
