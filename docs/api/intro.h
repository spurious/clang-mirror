@section main_intro Introduction
Welcome to the clang project.

<br>
This documentation describes the <b>internal</b> software that makes 
up clang, not the <b>external</b> use of clang. There are no instructions
here on how to use clang, only the APIs that make up the software. For 
usage instructions, please see the programmer's guide or reference 
manual.

@section main_caveat Caveat 
This documentation is generated directly from the source code with Doxygen. 
Since clang is constantly under active development, what you're about to
read is out of date!
