<h1>Open Projects</h1>

<p>This page lists several projects that would boost analyzer's usability and 
power. Most of the projects listed here are infrastructure-related so this list 
is an addition to the <A href="potential_checkers.html">potential checkers list</A>.
 If you are interested in tackling one of these, please send an email to 
<a href=http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev>cfe-dev mailing list</a> 
to notify other members of the community.</p>

<ul>  
  <li>Core Analyzer Infrastructure
  <ul>
    <li>Explicitly model C++ standard library functions with <tt>BodyFarm</tt>.
    <p><tt><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1BodyFarm.html">BodyFarm</a></tt> 
    allows the analyzer to explicitly model functions, whose definitions are 
    not available during analysis. Modeling more of the widely used functions 
    (such as <tt>std::string</tt>) will improve precision of the analysis. 
    <i>(Difficulty: Easy)</i><p>
    </li>
    
    <li>Implement generalized loop execution modeling.
    <p>Currently, the analyzer simply unrolls each loop <tt>N</tt> times. This 
    means that it will not execute any code after the loop if the loop is 
    guaranteed to execute more than <tt>N</tt> times. This results in lost 
    basic block coverage. We could continue exploring the path if we could 
    model a generic <tt>i</tt>-th iteration of a loop.
    <i> (Difficulty: Hard)</i></p>
    </li>

    <li>Enhance CFG to model C++ destructors and/or exceptions.
    <p><i>(Difficulty: Medium)</i></p>    
    
    <li>Design and Implement alpha-renaming.
    <p>Implement unifying two symbolic values along a path after they are 
    determined to be equal via comparison. This would allow us to reduce the 
    number of false positives and would be a building step to more advanced 
    analyzes, such as summary-based interprocedural and cross-translation-unit 
    analysis. 
    <i>(Difficulty: Hard)</i></p>
    </li>    
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Bug Reporting 
  <ul>
    <li>Add support for displaying multi-file path in scan-build output.
    <p>Currently scan-build output does not display reports that span multiple 
    files. The main problem is that we do not have the infrastructure to 
    display such paths in HTML output. <i>(Difficulty: Medium)</i> </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>Relate bugs to checkers.
    <p>We need to come up with bug reports API, which will relate bug reports 
    to the checkers that produce them and refactor the existing code to use the 
    new API. This would allow us to identify the checker from the bug report. 
    <i>(Difficulty: Medium-easy)</i></p>
    </li>
    
    <li>Refactor <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/BugReporter_8cpp_source.html">BugReporter.cpp</a>.
    <p>It would be great to have more code reuse between "Minimal" and 
    "Extensive" PathDiagnostic generation algorithms. One idea is to create an 
    IR for representing path diagnostics, which would be later be used to 
    generate minimal or extensive report output. <i>(Difficulty: Medium)</i></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Other Infrastructure 
  <ul>
    <li>Create 'analyzer_annotate' attribute for the analyzer annotations.<p>
    We would like to put all analyzer attributes behind a fence so that we 
    could add/remove them without worrying that compiler (not analyzer) users 
    depend on them. Design and implement such a generic analyzer attribute in 
    the compiler. <i>(Difficulty: Medium)</i></p>
    </li>

    <li>Rewrite scan-build (in python). <p><i>(Difficulty: Easy)</i></p>
    </li>    
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Enhanced Checks
  <ul>
    <li>Implement a production-ready StreamChecker.
    <p>A SimpleStreamChecker has been presented in the Building a Checker in 24 
    Hours talk 
    (<a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2012-11/Zaks-Rose-Checker24Hours.pdf">slides</a>
    <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2012-11/videos/Zaks-Rose-Checker24Hours.mp4">video</a>). 
    We need to implement a production version of the checker with richer set of 
    APIs and evaluate it by running on real codebases. 
    <i>(Difficulty: Easy)</i></p>
    </li>

    <li>Extend Malloc checker with reasoning about custom allocator, 
    deallocator, and ownership-transfer functions.
    <p>This would require extending MallocPessimistic checker with reasoning 
    about annotated functions. It is strongly desired that one would rely on 
    the 'analyzer_annotate' attribute, as described in one of the items above. 
    <i>(Difficulty: Easy)</i></p>
    </li>

    <li>Implement iterators invalidation checker.
    <p><i>(Difficulty: Easy)</i></p>
    </li>
    
    <li>Write checkers which catch Copy and Paste errors.
    <p>Take a look at the following paper for inspiration 
    <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shanlu/paper/TSE-CPMiner.pdf">CP-Miner</a>. 
    <i>(Difficulty: Medium-hard)</i></p>
