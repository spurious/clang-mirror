<h1>Getting Involved with the Clang Project</h1>

<p>Once you have <a href="get_started.html">checked out and built</a> clang and
played around with it, you might be wondering what you can do to make it better
and contribute to its development.  Alternatively, maybe you just want to follow
the development of the project to see it progress.
</p>

<h2>Follow what's going on</h2>

<p>Clang is a subproject of the <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM Project</a>, but
has its own mailing lists because the communities have people with different
interests.  The two clang lists are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-commits">cfe-commits
</a> - This list is for patch submission/discussion.</li>

<li><a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev">cfe-dev</a> - 
This list is for everything else clang related (questions and answers, bug
reports, etc).</li>

</ul>

<p>If you are interested in clang only, these two lists should be all
you need.  If you are interested in the LLVM optimizer and code generator,
please consider signing up for <a 
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">llvmdev</a> and <a
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvm-commits">llvm-commits</a>
as well.</p>


<p>The best way to talk with other developers on the project is through the <a
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev">cfe-dev mailing
list</a>.  The clang mailing list is a very friendly place and we welcome
newcomers.  In addition to the cfe-dev list, a significant amount of design
discussion takes place on the <a 
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-commits">cfe-commits mailing
list</a>.  All of these lists have archives, so you can browse through previous
discussions or follow the list development on the web if you prefer.</p>


<h2>Open Projects</h2>

<p>Here are a few tasks that are available for newcomers to work on.  This list
is provided to generate ideas, it is not intended to be comprehensive.  Please
ask on cfe-dev for more specifics or to verify that one of these isn't already
completed. :)</p>

<p>Please note that the information provided here is not completely thorough.
This is intentional. If you plan to work on Clang, we would like you to get
involved with the other developers. This will allow us to work together better
and will give you a better feel for how things are done.</p>


<ul>
<li><b>Compile your favorite C/ObjC project with "clang -fsyntax-only"</b>:
the clang type checker and verifier is quite close to complete (but not bug
free!) for C and Objective C.  We appreciate all reports of code that is
rejected by the front-end, and if you notice invalid code that is not rejected
by clang, that is also very important to us.</li>
