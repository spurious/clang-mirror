		<h1>Clang: a C language front-end for LLVM</h1>
		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>The goal of the Clang project is to create a new <a href="http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/LICENSE.TXT">BSD Licensed</a> C, C++, & ObjC front-end for the <a href="http://www.llvm.org/">LLVM</a> compiler.
		<br><br>
		<p>In the context of this website, the term Clang actually refers to two things:
		<p>1) A "code name" for the LLVM compiler front-end.
		<p>2) A specific library in the LLVM front-end -- in particular the "driver" that makes all the other libraries work together.
		<br><br>
		<p>The developers of Clang include contributers from Apple and numerous other volunteers.
		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p>The development of a new front-end was started out of a need -- a need for a compiler that allows better diagnostics, better integration with IDEs, a license that is compatible with commercial products, and a compiler that is easier to develop and maintain.  All of these were motiviations for starting work on a new C/C++/ObjC front-end that could meet these needs.
		<p>An excellent introduction to Clang can be found in the following video lectures:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="clang_video-05-25-2007.html">Clang Introduction</a>
			<li><a href="clang_video-07-25-2007.html">Features and Performance of Clang</a>
		</ul>
		<h2>Features/Goals</h2>
		Some of the goals for the project include the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Unified parser for C-based languages
			<li>Language conformance with C99, ObjC, C++
			<li>Real-world, production quality compiler
			<li>GCC compatibility
			<li>Library based architecture with finely crafted C++ API’s
			<li>High performance
			<li>Better integration with IDEs
			<li>Expressive diagnostics
			<li>BSD License
		</ul>
		Of course this is only a rough outline of the goals and features of Clang.  To get a true sense of what the new LLVM front-end is all about, as well as why you might want to considering using it, see the <a href="features.html">Features</a> section.
