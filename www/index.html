    <h1>clang: a C language family frontend for LLVM</h1>
    
    <p>The goal of the Clang project is to create a new C, C++, Objective C and
    Objective C++ front-end for the <a href="http://www.llvm.org/">LLVM</a>
    compiler.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="goals">Features and Goals</a></h2>
    
    <p>Some of the goals for the project include the following:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Real-world, production quality compiler.</li>
    <li>A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++, and Objective
        C++.</li>
    <li>Language conformance with these languages and  their variants, like
        C90, C99, etc.</li>
    <li>GCC compatibility: support GCC extensions, but allow them to be
        disabled.</li>
    <li><a href="features.html#performance">High performance and low memory
         use</a>.</li>
    <li>Support many clients such as refactoring, static analysis, as well as
        code generation.</li>
    <li>Build a library-based architecture with finely crafted APIs, allowing
        the code to be reused in many ways.</li>
    <li>Design for integration with IDEs as well as code generation with the
        <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM Optimizer and Code Generator</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="features.html#expressivediags">Expressive diagnostics</a>:
        warnings and errors that are actually helpful and make sense.</li>
    <li>Use the LLVM <a
        href="http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/LICENSE.TXT">'BSD'
        License</a>.</li>
    <li>Finally, make the code clean and simple enough to make it understandable
        to anyone who knows the languages involved and has a basic idea of
        compilers work.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Of course this is only a rough outline of the goals and features of
       Clang.  To get a true sense of what it is all about, see the <a 
       href="features.html">Features</a> section.  The Features section breaks
       each of these down and explains them in more detail.</p>
       
       
     <h2>Why?</h2>
    
    <p>The development of a new front-end was started out of a need -- a need
       for a compiler that allows better diagnostics, better integration with
       IDEs, a license that is compatible with commercial products, and a
       nimble compiler that is easy to develop and maintain.  All of these were
       motivations for starting work on a new front-end that could
       meet these needs.</p>
       
    <p>A good (but quite dated) introduction to Clang can be found in the
       following video lectures:</p>
       
    <ul>
      <li><a href="clang_video-05-25-2007.html">Clang Introduction</a>
          (May 2007)</li>
      <li><a href="clang_video-07-25-2007.html">Features and Performance of 
          Clang</a>  (July 2007)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For a more detailed comparison between Clang and other compilers, please
       see the <a href="comparison.html">clang comparison page</a>.</p>
    
   <h2>Current Status</h2>
    
    <p>Clang is still in early development stages.  If you are looking for
    source analysis or source-to-source transformation tools, clang is probably
    a great solution for you.  If you want to use it as a drop in C compiler, it
    is not yet ready.</p>

    <p>Clang currently has pretty good parsing and semantic analysis support for
       C and Objective-C right now, and bugs are usually quickly fixed once
       reported.  C++ support is still very early, and we don't expect to have
       respectable C++ support for another 2 years or so.</p>
    
    <h2>Get Involved</h2>
    
    <p>The developers of Clang include contributers from Apple and numerous
       other volunteers.  If you are interested in joining the community or
       learning more, please consider joining the <a
